# PoEditor Android Gradle Plug-in
[![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/bq/poeditor-android-gradle-plugin.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#bq/poeditor-android-gradle-plugin)

Simple plug-in that eases importing [PoEditor](https://poeditor.com) localized strings to your Android project.

## Purpose
This plug-in super-charges your Android project by providing tasks to download your localized strings from the PoEditor service into you Android project.
It also provides a built-in syntax to handle placeholders to enhance the already awesome Android support from PoEditor.

## Setting Up
In your main `build.gradle`, add [jitpack.io](https://jitpack.io/) repository in the `buildscript` block and include the plug-in as a dependency:

<details open><summary>Groovy</summary>

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories { 
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.github.bq:poeditor-android-gradle-plugin:1.1.0'
    }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Kotlin</summary>

```kt
buildscript {
    repositories { 
        maven("https://jitpack.io")
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("com.github.bq:poeditor-android-gradle-plugin:1.1.0")
    }
}
```

</details>

## How to use
Apply and configure the plug-in in your app's `build.gradle` file:
<details open><summary>Groovy</summary>

```groovy
apply plugin: "com.android.application"
apply plugin: "com.bq.poeditor"

poEditor {
    apiToken = "your_api_token"
    projectId = 12345
    defaultLang = "en"
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Kotlin</summary>

```kt
plugins {
    id "com.android.application"
    id "com.bq.poeditor"
}

poEditor {
    apiToken = "your_api_token"
    projectId = 12345
    defaultLang = "en"
}
```

</details>

The complete attribute list is the following:

Attribute                     | Description
------------------------------|-----------------------------------------
```apiToken```                | PoEditor API Token.
```projectId```               | PoEditor project ID.
```defaultLang```             | The lang to be used to build default ```strings.xml``` (```/values``` folder)

After the configuration is done, just run the new ```importPoEditorStrings``` task via Android Studio or command line:

```
./gradlew importPoEditorStrings
```

This task will:
* Download all strings files (every available lang) from PoEditor given the api token and project id.
* Process the incoming strings to fix some PoEditor incompatibilities with Android strings system. 
* Create and save strings.xml files to ```/values-<lang>``` (or ```/values``` in case of the default lang). It supports
region specific languages by creating the proper folders (i.e. ```/values-es-rMX```).

## Handling multiple flavors and build types

Sometimes we might want to import different strings for a given flavor (for example, in white label apps, we could have
different string definitions depending on the brand where they're used). The plugin supports this kind of apps by providing
specific configurations via the `poEditorConfig` block.

Let's see an example configuration:

<details open><summary>Groovy</summary>

```groovy
poEditor {
    // Default config that applies to all flavor/build type configurations. 
    // Also executed when calling 'importPoEditorStrings'
}

android {
    // If you have the following flavors...
    flavorDimensions 'type'
    productFlavors {
        free { dimension 'type' }
        paid { dimension 'type' }
    }

    poEditorConfig {
        free {
            // Configuration for the free flavor, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
        paid {
            // Configuration for the paid flavor, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
        debug {
            // Configuration for the debug build type, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
        release {
            // Configuration for the release build type, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Kotlin</summary>

```kt
poEditor {
    // Default config that applies to all flavor/build type configurations. 
    // Also executed when calling 'importPoEditorStrings'
}

android {
    // If you have the following flavors...
    flavorDimensions("type")

    productFlavors {
        register("free") { setDimension("type") }
        register("paid") { setDimension("type") }
    }

    poEditorConfig {
        register("free") {
            // Configuration for the free flavor, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
        register("paid") {
            // Configuration for the paid flavor, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
        register("debug") {
            // Configuration for the debug build type, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
        register("release") {
            // Configuration for the release build type, same syntax as the standard 'poEditor' block
        }
    }
}
```

</details>

Each flavor (`free` and `paid`) and build type (`debug` and `release`) will have its own task to import strings for said
configuration: `importFreePoEditorStrings`, `importPaidPoEditorStrings`, `importDebugPoEditorStrings` and 
`importReleasePoEditorStrings`.

Now the `importPoEditorStrings` task will import the main strings configured in the `poEditor` block and also the
strings for each defined flavor or build type.


## Handling tablet specific strings

You can mark some strings as tablet specific strings by adding ```_tablet```suffix to the string key in PoEditor. 
The plug-in will extract tablet strings to its own XML and save it in ```values-<lang>-sw600dp```.

If you define the following string in PoEditor:
```welcome_message: Hey friend``` and ```welcome_message_tablet: Hey friend how are you doing today, you look great!```

The plug-in will create two `strings.xml` files:

`/values/strings.xml`
```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey friend</string>
```

`/values-sw600dp/strings.xml`
```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey friend how are you doing today, you look great!</string>
```

## Handling placeholders
You can add placeholders to your strings. We've defined a placeholder markup to use in PoEditor string definition: it uses a double braces syntax, like this one

```
{{value}}
```

The PoEditor string:

```
welcome_message: Hey {{user_name}} how are you
``` 

will become, in `strings.xml`

```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey %1$s how are you</string>
```

If you need more than one placeholder in the same string, you can use ordinals too:

PoEditor string:

```
welcome_message: Hey {1{user_name}} how are you, today offer is {2{current_offer}}
``` 

will become, `in strings.xml`

```xml
<string name="welcome_message">Hey %1$s how are you, today offer is %2$s</string>
```

This way you could change the order of the placeholders depending on the language:

PoEditor string with Spanish translation:

```
welcome_message: La oferta del día es {2{current_offer}} para ti, {1{user_name}}
``` 

will become, in `values-es/strings.xml`

```xml
<string name="welcome_message">La oferta del día es %2$s para ti, %1$s</string>
```
